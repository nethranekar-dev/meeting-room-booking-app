## 📋 Your GitHub URL Will Be:
```
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/meeting-room-booking-flutter
```

## ✅ Before You Push - Checklist

- [ ] Firebase credentials are placeholders (not real keys)
- [ ] No node_modules or .dart_tool/ folders in git
- [ ] README.md looks professional
- [ ] All 5 main files exist: main.dart, login_screen.dart, dashboard_screen.dart, booking.dart, firestore_service.dart

---

## 🎯 What Recruiters Will See

When they open your GitHub link:

1. **README.md** → "Oh, this looks professional!"
2. **lib/ folder** → "Clean architecture, I like it"
3. **Open main.dart** → "Firebase setup, nice"
4. **Open dashboard_screen.dart** → "Full CRUD with Firestore? This person knows their stuff!"
5. **Check pubspec.yaml** → "Firebase + Flutter Web, legit"

---

## 💬 After Pushing, Tell Recruiters:

> "I built a professional Meeting Room Booking app with Flutter Web and Firebase. 
> It demonstrates full CRUD operations, real-time data sync, and clean architecture."

---

## 🎓 Why This Project Stands Out

- ✅ Real functionality (not just a tutorial)
- ✅ Production-ready code structure
- ✅ Cloud database integration
- ✅ Professional UI/UX
- ✅ Complete CRUD operations
- ✅ Shows you understand modern app development

---

## 📚 Files to Highlight

Share these 3 files with recruiters:

1. **lib/screens/dashboard_screen.dart** - Shows CRUD + real-time updates
2. **lib/services/firestore_service.dart** - Shows backend integration
3. **lib/models/booking.dart** - Shows clean data modeling

---

## 🔒 Important Security Notes

Before pushing to GitHub:

- [ ] No real Firebase API keys (use placeholders)
- [ ] No hardcoded passwords
- [ ] No .env files with secrets
- [ ] .gitignore prevents uploads of node_modules, build/

**Your code shows:** "I know security best practices"
